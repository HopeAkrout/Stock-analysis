### Analyzing data on green energy stocks to determine which stocks are the best investment

## Results:

While it looks like all but VSLR showed a moderate to exceedingly successful return in 2017, only ENPH and RUN presented with sustained growth.  Without knowing about the particulars of a company and the long-term impact and importance they have within the field of green energy, it's difficult to know whether or not companies that have a less dramatic difference in return from one year to another are merely the normal fluctuations of competition, or the impact of a declining company where stockholders are jumping ship.  Because the stock returns also show such a dramatically different scale from 2017 to 2018, it would be helpful to have more than two years' worth of data to see a larger trend.

As the clients initially invested in DQ, my first recommendation would be to sell the stock as soon as possible.  It was the one company with the most dramatic fall in stock at a 262% difference from 2017 to 2018.  Both ENPH and RUN had the most positive increase both in 2017 and 2018 which indicates the most stability and best return on investment.

For the lowest risk stocks, TERP had the smallest change from year to year at 2%, though the returns were both negative. AY showed the next to smallest loss at a 16% drop.  There's also an overall concern that green energy stocks are on the downturn when looking at stocks between 2017 and 2018.  As it's still a relatively new and unstable industry, alongside the political agenda backing fossil fuel and attempting to bring back coal in particular during this time period, it made investing in green energy riskier than low volitility stocks from established markets like Coca-Cola, Disney or Apple.

Ultimately, the clients want to invest in green energy more than they want to invest in stock solely for the most gauranteed return, so I would encourage them to look into investing in ENPH, RUN, and even a small investment in TERP if after further research the company shows longevity.  The script shows that runtime was relatively instant and user friendly so clients can easily review the data and come to their own conclusions on how to proceed with their investments.


## Summary: 
The advantages of refactoring code is that half the work is done for you as long as the steps are well defined to make it possible to replace the code necessary for the new task.  However, by refactoring a code it's easy for it to become convoluted or clunky instead of writing the code from scratch as you learn better ways to write commands.  And unless the code was written for the same type of situation, it's not necesarily easier to refactor code to fit the new situation instead of planning out what the best steps are for that particular task.  In this case, refactoring the original script was for the same subject and data, so the task was superfluous when the original output showed the same results.
